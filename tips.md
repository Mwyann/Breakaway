Important: I discovered a plug-in related bug in all previous Breakaway Live versions.
Effects plug-ins were told the sample rate of the Output device, even though they're running on the Input device clock!
So, with previous BA Live versions, unless Input and Output sample rates are the same, the vuvuzela filter WILL NOT WORK.

Here is a fixed version: Breakaway Live 0.90.96b
